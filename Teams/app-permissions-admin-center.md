# View app permissions and grant admin consent in Teams admin center

If you're a global admin, you can review, and grant consent to apps that request permissions on behalf of all users in your organization. You do this so that users don't have to review and accept the permissions requested by the app when they start the app. Additionally, depending on the user's [consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent) in Microsoft Entra ID, some users may not be allowed to grant consent to apps that access company data.
