# Use app centric management to manage apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using app permission policies to manage access to apps, see [Use app permission policies to control user access to apps](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can add and use Teams apps. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. We retain the existing access of apps in your organization.

You control and can set default access for the new apps that are published to the Teams app store. You can manage access to apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

## What changes with this feature

When using policies, the following three settings determined if a user can add and use an app:

* Permission policy: Applied to a user to define apps that are allowed or blocked for a specific user.
* App status: Allow or block settings for a specific app.
* Org-wide setting for third-party apps: Applied for the entire organization.

App centric management feature simplifies these settings by having each app define who can use the app, so that you can handle each app differently based on your user's needs and organization's compliance and risk posture. When using this functionality, you define app assignments by choosing one of the following options for each app:

* **Everyone in the organization**: Anyone in your org can add and use the app.
* **Specific users or groups**: Only the selected users and groups can use the app. The supported group types are Security, Microsoft 365, Dynamic, and Distributed Lists (DLs).
* **No one**: Nobody in the organization can use the app. Any existing users lose access to the app.

## Manage app availability

As an admin, you can manage app availability, deciding which users can add Teams apps in your organization from the Teams app store. You have complete control over who can or can't add and use apps in your organization.

## Add or modify app assignments

To assign users or groups to an app, follow these steps:

1. In Teams admin center, go to the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, search for the required app, and select the app name to open its app details page.

1. Select the **Assignments** tab.

1. Select **Assign** or **Assign app**.

1. Select the required option from **Manage who can install this app** menu. When assigning users or groups, search for the user or the group from the **Search for users or groups** menu. Select **Apply**.

1. To remove one or more users or groups from an app, select the rows and select **Remove**.

## Block an app

You can block an app for all users in the organization and restrict them from adding and using the app in Teams.

1. In Teams admin center, go to the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, search for the required app, and select the app name to open its app details page.

1. Select **Actions** > **Block app**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/acm-block-app.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to block access to an app for an entire organization from the Actions menu in app details page.":::

When you block an app, you can still view and modify the assignments but the assignments take effect only when you allow the app.

## Customize the default settings for app availability

You can control the default app assignments of any new and incoming app in your organization for all types of apps. The default setting is set to `Let users install available apps by default`. To change this default setting, access [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page, select **Actions** > **Org-wide app settings**, and modify the required settings.

The default tenant settings apply in the following cases:

* All new and incoming Teams apps.
* All apps published in the past that weren't managed by you.

If you make any app assignments, then the assignments supersede the default organization settings. Teams admin center honors the admin changes over the default settings.

## View apps in your organization

You can view all apps in the catalog and easily access the app assignments from the [Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps) page. You can sort and filter using all 3 types of app assignments. You can combine this filter with other types of available filters.

:::image type="content" source="media/acm-app-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to filter apps by combing various criteria.":::

### View and modify app access for a user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user to open the user details page, and select the **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. To easily locate the type of access for an app, you can search for the name of the app.

:::image type="content" source="media/acm-manage-user-apps-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing how to view all the apps that a user has access to, from the Manage users page.":::

Each app displays the assignment type, which indicates how the user was assigned to the app: through assignment to everyone, direct user assignment, or through a group. The list shows only those apps that are assigned to the user and that are allowed in the organization for use. Apps assigned to no one and app that are blocked in the organization don't appear in this list.

You can remove app assignment for a user. Select an app that is directly assigned to the user and select **Remove**. You canâ€™t remove assignments for a user if the app is available to everyone or to a group.

## App access controls for apps before and after migration
