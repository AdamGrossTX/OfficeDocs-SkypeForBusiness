# Use app centric management to manage apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using app permission policies to manage access to apps, see [Use app permission policies to control user access to apps](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can add and use Teams apps. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. We migrate the existing app permission policies to retain the existing access of apps in your organization.

You control and can set default access for the new apps that are published to the Teams app store. You can manage access to apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

## What changes with this feature

When using policies, the following three settings determine if a user can add and use an app:

* App permission policy applied to a user
* Allow or block settings for an app
* Org-wide setting for third-party apps usage in the org

App centric management feature simplifies these settings by having each app define who can use the app, so that you can handle each app differently based on your user's needs and organization's compliance and risk posture. When using this functionality, you define app assignments that is just a selection of one of the following options:

* **Everyone in the organization**: Anyone in your org can add and use the app.
* **Specific users or groups**: Only the selected users and groups can use the app. The supported group types are Security, Microsoft 365, Dynamic, and Distributed Lists (DLs).
* **No one**: Nobody in the organization can use the app. Any existing users lose access to the app.

## Manage apps after the migration

Once your org is migrated, you can manage the apps in Teams admin center by assigning apps from Manage apps, App details and User details pages. The default value of app assignment is **Everyone in the organization** in the organization. Admins can change the default value to **No one**. It's achieved by modifying the Org-wide app settings for new third-party apps and applies to [Microsoft apps](apps-in-teams.md#apps-created-by-microsoft) and [custom apps](apps-in-teams.md#custom-apps-created-within-an-organization-for-internal-use). It means that if the setting for new third-party apps is checked, new apps have **Everyone in the organization** assignment type. If the option is unchecked, the new apps enter the catalog with **No one** assignment type.

### View and modify access to an app

To modify access to an app, follow these steps:

1. In Teams admin center, go to the **[Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)** page, search for the required app, and select the app name to open its app details page.

1. Select the **Assignments** tab.

1. To assign a new user or a group, follow these steps:

   1. Select **Manage access** or **Assign**.
   1. Select the required option from **Manage who can install this app** menu.

   1. Search and select a user or a group from the **Add users and groups** field. Select **Apply**.

1. To remove one or more users or groups from an app, select the rows, and select **Remove**.

### Set default behavior for new apps published in Teams store

To control the default assignment of the new apps that are added to Teams store, use the **New third-party apps published to the store** option in the org-wide app settings.

* To make new apps available to everyone, set the option on.
* To make new apps available to no one, set the option off.

### View app access for a user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user, and select **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. To easily locate the type of access for an app, you can search for the name of the app.

### Modify app assignments for a specific user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user, and select **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. Select the row for an app and select **Remove**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can’t remove assignments for a user from Manage users page, if the app is available to everyone or to a group in the organization.

## Limitations and troubleshooting

Consider the following limitations about the functionality:

* You can’t migrate one or a few policies. You must migrate your entire org and all policies in your tenant. During migration you can choose some policies and ignore the others, but migration is of the complete org.
* While the migration is in progress, you can’t modify third-party app settings and policies.

   :::image type="content" source="media/acm-migration-settings-unavailable.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing that org-wide app settings can't be changed if a migration progress is drafted.":::

* PowerShell commands or APIs aren't available. If you're interested in these methods, provide product feedback to Microsoft from within the Teams admin center.
* Bulk operations on multiple apps aren’t supported.
* You can’t export the app assignments outside the Teams admin center.
* App assignments are limited to 2000 users and groups.
* Nested groups aren't supported.

Consider the following tips to troubleshoot any issues that you can encounter during the migration:

* To roll back a migrated tenant, contact Microsoft support.
* App assignments to specific users and groups currently allow guest users to be individually assigned. While it displays as assigned, only the apps that are allowed for the entire org users are available to the guests.
* If the expected changes aren't implemented consider waiting up to 72 hours for app assignments to take effect.
* During the migration, if you see too many apps in the **Allowed for users and groups** tab awaiting admin inputs, then consider checking your permission policies. The selected policies have opposite assignments for these apps in your org.
* To block new apps for everyone, see [Set default behavior for new apps published in Teams store](#set-default-behavior-for-new-apps-published-in-teams-store).

## App access controls for apps before and after migration

If you tenant had only Global permission policy and not any custom policies then the following changes are made to the settings after the migration.

| App access settings before migration | Settings after migration |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|  Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Allow all` or Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others`  |  `Allow users install available apps by default` for Microsoft apps is set to on |
|  Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Block all` or Global permission policy for Microsoft apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for Microsoft apps is set to off |
|  Third party app setting in the org-wide settings was set to on; New third-party app setting in the org-wide setting was set to on; Global permission policy for third party apps was `Allow all`; or Global permission policy for third party apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others`  |  `Allow users install available apps by default` for third party apps is set to on |
|  Third party app setting in the org-wide settings was set to off; New third-party app setting in the org-wide setting was set to off; Global permission policy for third party apps was `Block all`; or Global permission policy for third party apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for third party apps is set to off |
|  Global permission policy for Custom apps was `Allow all` or Global permission policy for Custom apps was `Block an app(s), allow all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for custom apps is set to on |
|  Global permission policy for custom apps was `Block all` or Global permission policy for custom apps was `Allow app(s), Block all others` | `Allow users install available apps by default` for custom apps will be set to off |

> [!NOTE]
> This change retires the third-party apps settings and the new third-party apps in the catalog settings.

| App status before migration | Permission policy definition before migration | App assignment after migration |
