# Use app centric management to manage apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're using app permission policies to manage access to apps, see [Use app permission policies to control user access to apps](teams-app-permission-policies.md).

App centric management introduces new admin settings to control who in the tenant can add and use Teams apps. This feature replaces the existing app permission policies and provides admins with the ability to manage access to the app individually. We retain the existing access of apps in your organization.

You control and can set default access for the new apps that are published to the Teams app store. You can manage access to apps for users, groups, or everyone in the organization.

## What changes with this feature

When using policies, the following three settings determined if a user can add and use an app:

* Permission policy: Applied to a user to define apps that are allowed or blocked for a specific user.
* App status: Allow or block settings for a specific app.
* Org-wide setting for third-party apps: Applied for the entire organization.

App centric management feature simplifies these settings by having each app define who can use the app, so that you can handle each app differently based on your user's needs and organization's compliance and risk posture. When using this functionality, you define app assignments by choosing one of the following options for each app:

* **Everyone in the organization**: Anyone in your org can add and use the app.
* **Specific users or groups**: Only the selected users and groups can use the app. The supported group types are Security, Microsoft 365, Dynamic, and Distributed Lists (DLs).
* **No one**: Nobody in the organization can use the app. Any existing users lose access to the app.

## Manage app availability

As an admin, you can manage app availability, deciding which users can add Teams apps in your organization from the Teams app store. You have complete control over who can or can't add and use apps in your organization.







### View and modify access to an app

To modify access to an app, follow these steps:

1. In Teams admin center, go to the **[Manage apps](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps)** page, search for the required app, and select the app name to open its app details page.

1. Select the **Assignments** tab.

1. To assign a new user or a group, follow these steps:

   1. Select **Manage access** or **Assign**.
   1. Select the required option from **Manage who can install this app** menu.

1. To remove one or more users or groups from an app, select the rows, and select **Remove**.







### Set default behavior for new apps published in Teams store

To control the default assignment of the new apps that are added to Teams store, use the **New third-party apps published to the store** option in the org-wide app settings.

* To make new apps available to everyone, set the option on.
* To make new apps available to no one, set the option off.







### View app access for a user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user, and select **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. To easily locate the type of access for an app, you can search for the name of the app.

### Modify app assignments for a specific user

On the **[Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users)** page, select a user, and select **Apps** tab. The tab lists the apps that the user has access to. Select the row for an app and select **Remove**.

> [!NOTE]
> You canâ€™t remove assignments for a user from the [Manage users](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users) page, if the app is available to everyone or to a group in the organization.
